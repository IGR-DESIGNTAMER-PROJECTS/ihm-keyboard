Prototype for an ergonomical keyboard creation tool
===

## Top part
The top left design is the initial one the user will be greated with after creating a project. They can place the keys in the space, resize and even place them in folders.

The keys are square shaped by default, but the user might want to have keys with more complex forms defined by a svg.

If they do not want to add everything by themselves, they can import a pre-defined a layout or one they have in a file.

## Bottom part

After setting the key placement, they can then set the action on every key, would it be a simple action that can be input simply by double clicking it or by opening a more complex menu to input special characters with key combos like CTRL for the Ctrl key, which might not be always suitable for grabbing. A list of all available special keys might be available by scrolling down the menu or in a separate manual. Key combos and special characters might also be input.

Before exporting the user might see a final preview of all his keys before obtaining a JSON file that might also be fed back into the program for later edition
