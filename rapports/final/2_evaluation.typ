== Evaluation of the usability of the software for each Persona

To test the usability, we'll ask several people to implement the same keyboard, the complexity and layout of which will difer according to the persona for which we are testing the usability.

=== Maker

No idea, maybe a random of the three other would not be absurd.

=== General Hobbyist

For this profile, we chose to focus the test on keyboard efficient for dactylography.

To this end, we'll ask a student to configure a part of the characorder :

TODO : make a file that we will actually give people

=== Gamer hobbyist

For this profile, we chose to test a custom gamer keyboard layout, that will be fixated on the closeness of certain keys that help with speed and prevent the player from losing time moving their hands to much to do an action.

We have found that a gaming layout recommended is the colemak layout. Therefore, we asked our testers to implement it :

#figure(image("images/colemak_keyboard.png", width: 80%),)

=== Hobbyist with a disability
For this persona, we will test the following keyboard design. We chose this design because with disability, people might have trouble accessing a lot of keys, so we choose a keyboard with a small number of keys but a lot of layers.

People with disabilities might not be using letters and using voice dictation as one reddit user mentionned. However, they need the keyboard to allow them to move or correct the text and do text formatting in in limited number of keys. According to #link("https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/")[WEBAIM], you'll find in this link the most common interactions with non characters keys and therefore the most important to configure on this test keyboard.

=== Measuring the usability and success criteria

To measure the usability and success criteria, we will proceed in two phases :
- The first one will be during the use of the software : we will invite the participant to express all feelings and impressions they have toward the tool, wether for instance something is efficient, intuitive or not, if they have trouble finding a certain tool etc. During this time, we'll also evaluate the success criteria. According to each layout we will ask them to do, there will be different criteria as described before (to do), and we will evaluate them based on if the user successed in doing the task or not.
- The second part will be a post usage evaluation. We will ask the questions given before according to what layout we asked them to implement (to do according to the layout but basically if the tools were easy to use, if they found them easily etc)
