Our tool allows the user to fully create a custom keyboard layout, with all the layers allowed by any key combo they desire and with fully free placement, sizing and rotation of the keys. 

For now the app serves as a fully fledged design tool, but in the future we may want to implement several additional features to turn the tool into a companion for the whole creation pipeline : 

#bullet("A complete documentation")[For the users that prefer to read about how the program works before using it, as well as discover all it's capable of]

#bullet("Fully fledged controller support")[For the tool to be better suited with the movement impaired portion of our user-base.]

#bullet("Programmable export")[Exporting using a file format that might directly be imported into keyboards of different manufacturers to change their behavior. The compatibility list would most likely be expanded by the community if we allowed the tool to become an open-source project]

#bullet("More controllable key forms")[To allow the user to better customize the look and feel of their keyboard by importing custom SVG for their keys or using other premade   ones than the rectangles]

#bullet("A keyboard emulator")[To allow the user to visually see their designed keyboard react to all of their key inputs]

We hope that you enjoyed learning more about this project and the world of custom keyboards with us and that it may have made you interested in building your own custom keyboard in the future.
